# Linear_Systems----Linearity_and_Time_Invariance

This is an investigation into the response of linear and time-invariant systems to signals using Matlab.

For a set of given systems the user will determine if the system could satisfy the additivity property, the scaling property and the time-invariance property.

Here are the systems:
a) y(t) = 2x(t)
b) y(t)=x(t) + 1
c) y(t) = ln x(t)
d) y(t) = x^2 (t)
e) yâ€²(t) + 2 y(t) = 2x(t)
f) y(t) = x(t)u(t)
g) y(t) = tu(t)
