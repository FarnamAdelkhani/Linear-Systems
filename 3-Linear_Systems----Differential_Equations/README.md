# Linear_Systems----Differential_Equations

The goal of this section is to create functions to calculate exact values of solutions of an impulse. The function will be tested for a range of given differential equations to test for an accurate output. The remainder of the investigation will dive deeper into exploring functions to manipulate differential functions in Matlab.
