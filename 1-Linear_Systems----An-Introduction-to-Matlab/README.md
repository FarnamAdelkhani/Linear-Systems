# Linear_Systems----An-Introduction-to-Matlab-Basics-and-Fundamentals-for-Linear-Systems-Analysis

The goal of this investigation is to gain an overview and hopefully some understanding, into Matlab basics. In order to complete this assignment on your own or any of the assignments to follow for that matter, you must already have an understanding of Matlab or be willing to learn on your own while completing the work.

After this other topics will be covered, such as how to represent continous-time signals, such as those you would work with in a Linear Systems course. Be sure to cover this assignment in detail to diminish any extra time-wasted backtracking in the following assignments, which are challenging.
